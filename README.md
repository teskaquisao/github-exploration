Implement the front-end functionality to allow admin users to create a new appointment type by clicking on the "Create Appointment Type" button in the Appointment Types management page. This will involve designing the UI elements and ensuring the interaction works smoothly.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* The "Create Appointment Type" button is displayed prominently on the Appointment Types management page.
* When the button is clicked, a modal or new page opens with a form for entering the appointment type details (e.g., name, description, duration).
* The form includes validation to ensure required fields (e.g., name, description) are completed before submission.
* On successful submission, the new appointment type is displayed in the Appointment Types management list.
* If the form is submitted with errors or incomplete data, a clear error message is shown to the user.
* The page or modal returns the user to the Appointment Types management page after successful creation of a new appointment type.
* Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
